v0.29.2 – 2025-11-26

- Bumped version from 0.29.1 to 0.29.2.
- Updated the `modified` date to `2025-11-26`.
- Modified the `triggers` condition for `state_update_mode` in `mentor_generator.json`. The new trigger condition is now:
  ```
  "Only when `state_update_protocols.json_update_protocol.json_generation_triggers` conditions are met"
  ```

v0.29.1 – 2025-11-25

- Bumped version from 0.28.0 to 0.29.1.
- Updated question_8 to include learning strategy options (DEPTH-FIRST and TIME-BOXED) along with detailed descriptions.
- Removed the previous question_8 about time constraints.
- Moved `user_profile` from a separate section into `additional_context`.
- Added `constraints_and_strategy` within `additional_context`, including details like hardware limits, software stack, efficiency principles, study constraints, and system constraints.
- Updated the structure of `learning_changelog` to include `next_focus`.
- Added a new rule `pre_content_save_check` under `strict_turn_taking`. This rule ensures that before starting any new concept explanation, the mentor checks if a state update is required due to context depth. If so, it announces the need for a state update, requests user confirmation, and handles both confirmation and rejection scenarios.
- Added `context_limit_approaching` as a trigger condition under `json_update_protocol`. This sets an internal flag when the current token count exceeds the system constraints threshold.
- Updated the rules to include specific instructions for handling context limit approaching, ensuring that state updates occur only at the next available pedagogical break point.
- Clarified and expanded the `pacing_policy` under `constraints_and_strategy`.
- Added projects examples in README.md.
- Expanded warnings and best practices in both READMEs.
- Updated README_ru.md with a real example section for Deep Learning with PyTorch.

v0.28.0 – 2025-11-16

- Bumped version; renamed metadata fields (`created` → `birth`, `last_updated` → `modified`).
- Improved naming: human-readable `name`, lowercase placeholders, clearer step labels (e.g., `` `collection` complete ``).
- Restructured state management: moved session protocols under `session_resumption_protocol`, added `user_profile` root section.
- Consolidated `interaction_flow`, `response_architecture`, and `emergency_brake_rules` into a unified flow.
- Replaced flat `additional_context` with phased changelog (`phase_in_progress`, `finished_phases_logs`) and explicit retention rules.
- Added `zero_level_protocol` rule; fixed `external_resources_log` path.
- Minor cleanup: removed bolding, fixed grammar, standardized key references, trimmed redundancy.

0.27.0
- teaching_style demands honesty from the mentor

0.26.0
- socratic style removed - too many questions without ground theory

0.25.0
- emotionless added in `mentor_self_control.peer_reviewer_style`
- socratic style added
- session-based way turned to concepts_mastered-based way (before the mentor hurried to finish the session but we need to get the understanding from the user)

0.24.2
- changelog moved to a dedicated file, finally

0.24.1
- emergency_brake moved to list_of_rules
- concepts_mastered got the predefined structure
- resources_suggested got the predefined structure
